# Zabbix-Utils
Collection of scripts to help manage Zabbix

## Zabbix User Migrator script usage
Dependencies: https://github.com/express42/zabbixapi

Use cases: When in need to migrate users from one zabbix instance to another

To do ideas: bringing in the functionality for syncer rather than migrator, so with one script you could keep your two different zabbix installations in sync (user wise!)

Usage:
`ruby zabbix-user-migrator.rb`
